This is the Chinese document site for HAWQ. 
Powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) and [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Welcome to contribute to it (either in Chinese or English). 
A brief way to achieve it:

1. join the [hawq-cn](https://github.com/hawq-cn) organization
2. run `git clone git@github.com:hawq-cn/hawq-cn.github.io.git`
3. add a new post by writing a new file under *_posts/* dir
4. git push with a short comment (with author names in both comments and posts)
